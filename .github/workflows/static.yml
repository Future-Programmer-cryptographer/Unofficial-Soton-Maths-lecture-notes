            <h2>
These notes are not intended as a verbatim record of lectures, nor a complete textbook account of modules. Instead, they reflect how I came to understand the material. 

Ideas often appear here after I have struggled with them on paper and more often than not, misunderstood them. As a result, a lot of the explanations emphasises intuition and alternative viewpoints that helped concepts click for me, even if those perspectives were not presented explicitely in lectures. 

Where appropriate, I include questions I initially found confusing, common pitfalls, and informal explanation alongside formal definitions and proofs. The aim clarity over maximal completeness. So if something here feels over-explained, that's usually become it once confused me. </h2>
