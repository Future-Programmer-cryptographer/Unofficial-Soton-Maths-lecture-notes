### These notes are **not official** and are based on my understanding of lectures, problem sheets, and independent reading.  

These notes are not intended as a verbatim record of lectures, nor a complete textbook account of the modules. Instead, they reflect how I came to understand the material. 

Ideas often appear here after I have struggled with them on paper and more often than not, misunderstood them. As a result, a lot of the explanations emphasises intuition and alternative viewpoints that helped concepts click for me, even if those perspectives were not presented explicitely in lectures. 

Where appropriate, I include questions I initially found confusing, common pitfalls, and informal explanation alongside formal definitions and proofs. The aim is clarity over maximal completeness. So if something here feels over-explained, that's usually become it once confused me.

These notes may contain errors or simplifications. Always cross-check with official lecture notes, textbooks, or lecturers’ guidance before relying on them.

This repo contains my working notes for first-year mathematics modules at the Southampton currently include topics for the 2nd Semester: 
- Calculus II
- Linear Algebra II
- Dynamics and Relativity
- Computational Mathematics

1st Semester notes were made in Obsidian and deployed on Vercel instead of GitHub pages, which can be found here:
